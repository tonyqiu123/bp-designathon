    <title>AMATH Prof Talk</title>
    <link>https://www.instagram.com/p/DQhX2ZDDhmG/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[Come join us for an AMATH Prof Talk on neural networks and dynamical systems!

Abstract: In machine learning, neural networks are often used in a feed-forward manner. Or, when a population of neurons is recurrently connected, the updates happen in synchronized jumps. But the neurons in your brain are operating in continuous time. I will show you some ways to bridge the gap to biology, and treat networks of interconnected neurons as a dynamical system. Then, we'll co-opt those networks to do our bidding, and get them to solve dynamical systems.

Pizza and refreshments will be provided to PMC members.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Join the Women’s Centre and Glow on Friday, November 21 in the Women’s Centre (SLC 3104) for an event celebrating your body in a safe environment! Create a plaster cast of your chest as a way to honour and connect with your body.

No matter the size and shape of your bust, every woman-identifying person and non-binary-identifying person is welcome at the event!  

There will also be a discussion on the sexualization and feminization of chests, and how these narratives can perpetuate transphobia and body image issues. Together, we’ll explore new ways of seeing our bodies to help foster more positive and affirming self-perception.

Three FREE sessions are available:
11AM – 12 PM
1 PM – 2 PM
3 PM – 4 PM* Glow Centre – run session

Registration will be open from November 3 through November 21 at 3 p.m., or until all available spots are filled.
Please register early to secure your place using the link below!

⚠️ Accessibility, Comfort & Health Notice

This is a messy craft activity using paper mâché materials, so please wear clothes you don’t mind getting dirty.

Participants will remove clothing from their upper body in a small, private group setting (about 10 people). We understand this can feel vulnerable — please know it’s a safe and body-positive space, and you can opt out or pause at any time.

If you have allergies, skin sensitivities, or accessibility needs, please contact us in advance so we can make accommodations.

This event is exclusive to Waterloo undergrad students.]]></description>

Everyone is welcome. Every six days in Canada, a woman is killed by her intimate partner. In 2024 alone, 187 femicides were recorded nationwide 62 in Ontario between November 2023 and November 2024. This rise in violence demands action. We cannot stay silent. When we walk together, we honor those lost, stand with survivors, and raise funds to help women, gender-diverse people, and children move beyond violence. Together, we walk for change. 💜]]></description>
